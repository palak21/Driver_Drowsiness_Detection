# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
Humans have always invented machines and devised
techniques to ease and protect their lives for daily activities like
travelling to work or for more important purposes like aircraft
travel. Neglecting our duties towards a safer travel leads to
thousands of precious lives being lost and road accidents are
a leading reason of these. Although accidents occur due to a
number of reasons like breaking traffic rules, drunk driving, etc,
accidents that happen due to drivers feeling tired or drowsy and
thus loose control of the vehicle has seen an increase in recent
times. According to statistics, driver drowsiness was present in
around 8.5 to 9.3 percent of all crashes that happen. This usually
happens during late night or early morning or late afternoon
periods. In this project, we have proposed VGG and AlexNet
models with an accuracy of 98.2% and 96.5% respectively for
the classification of driver drowsiness and a demo model that will
detect driver drowsiness in real time based on the best performing
model and trigger an alarm that will be triggered in case the
person’s eyes are closed beyond a certain limit. Future Scope and
other related works have also been discussed.
